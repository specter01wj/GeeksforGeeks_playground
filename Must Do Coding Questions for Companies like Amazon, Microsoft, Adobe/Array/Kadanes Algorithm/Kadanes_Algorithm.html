		    solution:
		    Simple approach: Run three loops and check if there exists a triplet such that 
		    sum of two elements equals the third element.
			
			Time complexity: O(n^3)
			
			Efficient approach : The idea is similar to Find a triplet that sum to a given value.
			
			Sort the given array first.
			Start fixing the greatest element of three from back and traverse the array to find 
			other two numbers which sum upto the third element.
			Take two pointers j(from front) and k(initially i-1) to find the smallest of the two 
			number and from i-1 to find the largest of the two remaining numbers
			If the addition of both the numbers is still less than A[i], then we need to increase 
			the value of the summation of two numbers, thereby increase the j pointer, so as to 
			increase the value of A[j] + A[k].
			If the addition of both the numbers is more than A[i], then we need to decrease the 
			value of the summation of two numbers, thereby decrease the k pointer so as to 
			decrease the overall value of A[j] + A[k].
